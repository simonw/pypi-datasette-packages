If you want to read and write to an S3 bucket from an automated script somewhere, you'll need an access key and secret key to authenticate your calls. This tool helps you create those with the most restrictive permissions possible.\n\nIf your code is running in EC2 or Lambda you can likely solve this [using roles instead](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/lambda-execution-role-s3-bucket/). This tool is mainly useful for when you are interacting with S3 from outside the boundaries of AWS itself.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall this tool using `pip`:\n\n    $ pip install s3-credentials\n\n## Configuration\n\nThis tool uses [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/) under the hood which supports [a number of different ways](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html) of providing your AWS credentials.\n\nIf you have an existing `~/.aws/config` or `~/.aws/credentials` file the tool will use that.\n\nYou can set the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables before calling this tool.\n\nYou can also use the `--access-key=`, `--secret-key=`, `--session-token` and `--auth` options documented below.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe `s3-credentials create` command is the core feature of this tool. Pass it one or more S3 bucket names, specify a policy (read-write, read-only or write-only) and it will return AWS credentials that can be used to access those buckets.\n\nThese credentials can be **temporary** or **permanent**.\n\n- Temporary credentials can last for between 15 minutes and 12 hours. They are created using [STS.AssumeRole()](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html).\n- Permanent credentials never expire. They are created by first creating a dedicated AWS user, then assigning a policy to that user and creating and returning an access key for it.\n\nMake sure to record the `SecretAccessKey` because it will only be displayed once and cannot be recreated later on.\n\nIn this example I create permanent credentials for reading and writing files in my `static.niche-museums.com` S3 bucket:\n\n```\n% s3-credentials create static.niche-museums.com\n\nCreated user: s3.read-write.static.niche-museums.com with permissions boundary: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess\nAttached policy s3.read-write.static.niche-museums.com to user s3.read-write.static.niche-museums.com\nCreated access key for user: s3.read-write.static.niche-museums.com\n{\n    \"UserName\": \"s3.read-write.static.niche-museums.com\",\n    \"AccessKeyId\": \"AKIAWXFXAIOZOYLZAEW5\",\n    \"Status\": \"Active\",\n    \"SecretAccessKey\": \"...\",\n    \"CreateDate\": \"2021-11-03 01:38:24+00:00\"\n}\n```\nIf you add `--format ini` the credentials will be output in INI format, suitable for pasting into a `~/.aws/credentials` file:\n```\n% s3-credentials create static.niche-museums.com --format ini > ini.txt\nCreated user: s3.read-write.static.niche-museums.com with permissions boundary: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess\nAttached policy s3.read-write.static.niche-museums.com to user s3.read-write.static.niche-museums.com\nCreated access key for user: s3.read-write.static.niche-museums.com\n% cat ini.txt\n[default]\naws_access_key_id=AKIAWXFXAIOZKGXI4PVO\naws_secret_access_key=...\n```\n\nTo create temporary credentials, add `--duration 15m` (or `1h` or `1200s`). The specified duration must be between 15 minutes and 12 hours.\n\n```\n% s3-credentials create static.niche-museums.com --duration 15m\nAssume role against arn:aws:iam::462092780466:role/s3-credentials.AmazonS3FullAccess for 900s\n{\n    \"AccessKeyId\": \"ASIAWXFXAIOZPAHAYHUG\",\n    \"SecretAccessKey\": \"Nrnoc...\",\n    \"SessionToken\": \"FwoGZXIvYXd...mr9Fjs=\",\n    \"Expiration\": \"2021-11-11 03:24:07+00:00\"\n}\n```\nWhen using temporary credentials the session token must be passed in addition to the access key and secret key.\n\nThe `create` command has a number of options:\n\n- `--format TEXT`: The output format to use. Defaults to `json`, but can also be `ini`.\n- `--duration 15m`: For temporary credentials, how long should they last? This can be specified in seconds, minutes or hours using a suffix of `s`, `m` or `h` - but must be between 15 minutes and 12 hours.\n- `--username TEXT`: The username to use for the user that is created by the command (or the username of an existing user if you do not want to create a new one). If ommitted a default such as `s3.read-write.static.niche-museums.com` will be used.\n- `-c, --create-bucket`: Create the buckets if they do not exist. Without this any missing buckets will be treated as an error.\n- `--prefix my-prefix/`: Credentials should only allow access to keys in the S3 bucket that start with this prefix.\n- `--public`: When creating a bucket, set it so that any file uploaded to that bucket can be downloaded by anyone who knows its filename. This attaches the [public bucket policy](#public-bucket-policy) shown below.\n- `--read-only`: The user should only be allowed to read files from the bucket.\n- `--write-only`: The user should only be allowed to write files to the bucket, but not read them. This can be useful for logging and backups.\n- `--policy filepath-or-string`: A custom policy document (as a file path, literal JSON string or `-` for standard input) - see below.\n- `--statement json-statement`: Custom JSON statement block to be added to the generated policy.\n- `--bucket-region`: If creating buckets, the region in which they should be created.\n- `--silent`: Don't output details of what is happening, just output the JSON for the created access credentials at the end.\n- `--dry-run`: Output details of AWS changes that would have been made without applying them.\n- `--user-permissions-boundary`: Custom [permissions boundary](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html) to use for users created by this tool. The default is to restrict those users to only interacting with S3, taking the `--read-only` option into account. Use `none` to create users without any permissions boundary at all.\n\n### Changes that will be made to your AWS account\n\nHow the tool works varies depending on if you are creating temporary or permanent credentials.\n\nFor permanent credentials, the steps are as follows:\n\n1. Confirm that each of the specified buckets exists. If they do not and `--create-bucket` was passed create them - otherwise exit with an error.\n2. If a username was not specified, derive a username using the `s3.$permission.$buckets` format.\n3. If a user with that username does not exist, create one with an S3 permissions boundary of [AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess](https://github.com/glassechidna/trackiam/blob/master/policies/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess.json) for `--read-only` or [AmazonS3FullAccess](https://github.com/glassechidna/trackiam/blob/master/policies/AmazonS3FullAccess.json) otherwise - unless `--user-permissions-boundary=none` was passed, or a custom permissions boundary string.\n4. For each specified bucket, add an inline IAM policy to the user that gives them permission to either read-only, write-only or read-write against that bucket.\n5. Create a new access key for that user and output the key and its secret to the console.\n\nFor temporary credentials:\n\n1. Confirm or create buckets, in the same way as for permanent credentials.\n2. Check if an AWS role called `s3-credentials.AmazonS3FullAccess` exists. If it does not exist create it, configured to allow the user's AWS account to assume it and with the `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess` policy attached.\n3. Use `STS.AssumeRole()` to return temporary credentials that are restricted to just the specified buckets and specified read-only/read-write/write-only policy.\n\nYou can run the `create` command with the `--dry-run` option to see a summary of changes that would be applied, including details of generated policy documents, without actually applying those changes.\n\n### Using a custom policy\n\nThe policy documents applied by this tool [are listed below](https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/blob/main/README.md#policy-documents).\n\nIf you want to use a custom policy document you can do so using the `--policy` option.\n\nFirst, create your policy document as a JSON file that looks something like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": [\"s3:GetObject*\", \"s3:ListBucket\"],\n      \"Resource\": [\n        \"arn:aws:s3:::$!BUCKET_NAME!$\",\n        \"arn:aws:s3:::$!BUCKET_NAME!$/*\"\n      ],\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nNote the `$!BUCKET_NAME!$` strings - these will be replaced with the name of the relevant S3 bucket before the policy is applied.\n\nSave that as `custom-policy.json` and apply it using the following command:\n\n    % s3-credentials create my-s3-bucket \\\n        --policy custom-policy.json\n\nYou can also pass `-` to read from standard input, or you can pass the literal JSON string directly to the `--policy` option:\n```\n% s3-credentials create my-s3-bucket --policy '{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": [\"s3:GetObject*\", \"s3:ListBucket\"],\n      \"Resource\": [\n        \"arn:aws:s3:::$!BUCKET_NAME!$\",\n        \"arn:aws:s3:::$!BUCKET_NAME!$/*\"\n      ],\n    }\n  ]\n}'\n```\nYou can also specify one or more extra statement blocks that should be added to the generated policy, using `--statement JSON`. This example enables the AWS `textract:` APIs for the generated credentials, useful for using with the [s3-ocr](https://datasette.io/tools/s3-ocr) tool:\n```\n% s3-credentials create my-s3-bucket --statement '{\n  \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n  \"Action\": \"textract:*\",\n  \"Resource\": \"*\"\n}'\n```\n\n## Other commands\n\n### policy\n\nYou can use the `s3-credentials policy` command to generate the JSON policy document that would be used without applying it. The command takes one or more required bucket names and a subset of the options available on the `create` command:\n\n- `--read-only` - generate a read-only policy\n- `--write-only` - generate a write-only policy\n- `--prefix` - policy should be restricted to keys in the bucket that start with this prefix\n- `--statement json-statement`: Custom JSON statement block\n- `--public-bucket` - generate a bucket policy for a public bucket\n\nWith none of these options it defaults to a read-write policy.\n```\n% s3-credentials policy my-bucket --read-only\n{\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n...\n```\n\n### whoami\n\nTo see which user you are authenticated as:\n\n    s3-credentials whoami\n\nThis will output JSON representing the currently authenticated user.\n\nUsing this with the `--auth` option is useful for verifying created credentials:\n```\ns3-credentials create static.niche-museums.com --read-only > auth.json\ns3-credentials whoami --auth auth.json    \n{\n    \"UserId\": \"AIDAWXFXAIOZPIZC6MHAG\",\n    \"Account\": \"462092780466\",\n    \"Arn\": \"arn:aws:iam::462092780466:user/s3.read-only.static.niche-museums.com\"\n}\n```\n### list-users\n\nTo see a list of all users that exist for your AWS account:\n\n    s3-credentials list-users\n\nThis will a pretty-printed array of JSON objects by default.\n\nAdd `--nl` to collapse these to single lines as valid newline-delimited JSON.\n\nAdd `--csv` or `--tsv` to get back CSV or TSV data.\n\n### list-buckets\n\nShows a list of all buckets in your AWS account.\n\n    % s3-credentials list-buckets\n    [\n      {\n        \"Name\": \"aws-cloudtrail-logs-462092780466-f2c900d3\",\n        \"CreationDate\": \"2021-03-25 22:19:54+00:00\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"Name\": \"simonw-test-bucket-for-s3-credentials\",\n        \"CreationDate\": \"2021-11-03 21:46:12+00:00\"\n      }\n    ]\n\nWith no extra arguments this will show all available buckets - you can also add one or more explicit bucket names to see just those buckets:\n\n    % s3-credentials list-buckets simonw-test-bucket-for-s3-credentials\n    [\n      {\n        \"Name\": \"simonw-test-bucket-for-s3-credentials\",\n        \"CreationDate\": \"2021-11-03 21:46:12+00:00\"\n      }\n    ]\n\nThis accepts the same `--nl`, `--csv` and `--tsv` options as `list-users`.\n\nAdd `--details` to include details of the bucket ACL, website configuration and public access block settings. This is useful for running a security audit of your buckets.\n\nUsing `--details` adds three additional API calls for each bucket, so it is advisable to use it with one or more explicit bucket names.\n```\n% s3-credentials list-buckets simonw-test-public-website-bucket --details\n[\n  {\n    \"Name\": \"simonw-test-public-website-bucket\",\n    \"CreationDate\": \"2021-11-08 22:53:30+00:00\",\n    \"bucket_acl\": {\n      \"Owner\": {\n        \"DisplayName\": \"simon\",\n        \"ID\": \"abcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcde0001\"\n      },\n      \"Grants\": [\n        {\n          \"Grantee\": {\n            \"DisplayName\": \"simon\",\n            \"ID\": \"abcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcde0001\",\n            \"Type\": \"CanonicalUser\"\n          },\n          \"Permission\": \"FULL_CONTROL\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    \"public_access_block\": null,\n    \"bucket_website\": {\n      \"IndexDocument\": {\n        \"Suffix\": \"index.html\"\n      },\n      \"ErrorDocument\": {\n        \"Key\": \"error.html\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\nA bucket with `public_access_block` might look like this:\n```json\n{\n  \"Name\": \"aws-cloudtrail-logs-462092780466-f2c900d3\",\n  \"CreationDate\": \"2021-03-25 22:19:54+00:00\",\n  \"bucket_acl\": {\n    \"Owner\": {\n      \"DisplayName\": \"simon\",\n      \"ID\": \"abcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcde0001\"\n    },\n    \"Grants\": [\n      {\n        \"Grantee\": {\n          \"DisplayName\": \"simon\",\n          \"ID\": \"abcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcde0001\",\n          \"Type\": \"CanonicalUser\"\n        },\n        \"Permission\": \"FULL_CONTROL\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"public_access_block\": {\n    \"BlockPublicAcls\": true,\n    \"IgnorePublicAcls\": true,\n    \"BlockPublicPolicy\": true,\n    \"RestrictPublicBuckets\": true\n  },\n  \"bucket_website\": null\n}\n```\n\n### list-bucket\n\nTo list the contents of a bucket, use `list-bucket`:\n\n```\n% s3-credentials list-bucket static.niche-museums.com\n[\n  {\n    \"Key\": \"Griffith-Observatory.jpg\",\n    \"LastModified\": \"2020-01-05 16:51:01+00:00\",\n    \"ETag\": \"\\\"a4cff17d189e7eb0c4d3bf0257e56885\\\"\",\n    \"Size\": 3360040,\n    \"StorageClass\": \"STANDARD\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Key\": \"IMG_0353.jpeg\",\n    \"LastModified\": \"2019-10-25 02:50:49+00:00\",\n    \"ETag\": \"\\\"d45bab0b65c0e4b03b2ac0359c7267e3\\\"\",\n    \"Size\": 2581023,\n    \"StorageClass\": \"STANDARD\"\n  }\n]\n```\nYou can use the `--prefix myprefix/` option to list only keys that start with a specific prefix.\n\nThe commmand accepts the same `--nl`, `--csv` and `--tsv` options as `list-users`.\n\n### list-user-policies\n\nTo see a list of inline policies belonging to users:\n\n```\n% s3-credentials list-user-policies s3.read-write.static.niche-museums.com\n\nUser: s3.read-write.static.niche-museums.com\nPolicyName: s3.read-write.static.niche-museums.com\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": [\n        \"s3:ListBucket\"\n      ],\n      \"Resource\": [\n        \"arn:aws:s3:::static.niche-museums.com\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": \"s3:*Object\",\n      \"Resource\": [\n        \"arn:aws:s3:::static.niche-museums.com/*\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nYou can pass any number of usernames here. If you don't specify a username the tool will loop through every user belonging to your account:\n\n    s3-credentials list-user-policies\n\n### list-roles\n\nThe `list-roles` command lists all of the roles available for the authenticated account.\n\nAdd `--details` to fetch the inline and attached managed policies for each row as well - this is slower as it needs to make several additional API calls for each role.\n\nYou can optionally add one or more role names to the command to display and fetch details about just those specific roles.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n% s3-credentials list-roles AWSServiceRoleForLightsail --details\n[\n  {\n    \"Path\": \"/aws-service-role/lightsail.amazonaws.com/\",\n    \"RoleName\": \"AWSServiceRoleForLightsail\",\n    \"RoleId\": \"AROAWXFXAIOZG5ACQ5NZ5\",\n    \"Arn\": \"arn:aws:iam::462092780466:role/aws-service-role/lightsail.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForLightsail\",\n    \"CreateDate\": \"2021-01-15 21:41:48+00:00\",\n    \"AssumeRolePolicyDocument\": {\n      \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n      \"Statement\": [\n        {\n          \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n          \"Principal\": {\n            \"Service\": \"lightsail.amazonaws.com\"\n          },\n          \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    \"MaxSessionDuration\": 3600,\n    \"inline_policies\": [\n      {\n        \"RoleName\": \"AWSServiceRoleForLightsail\",\n        \"PolicyName\": \"LightsailExportAccess\",\n        \"PolicyDocument\": {\n          \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n          \"Statement\": [\n            {\n              \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n              \"Action\": [\n                \"kms:Decrypt\",\n                \"kms:DescribeKey\",\n                \"kms:CreateGrant\"\n              ],\n              \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:kms:*:451833091580:key/*\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n              \"Action\": [\n                \"cloudformation:DescribeStacks\"\n              ],\n              \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:cloudformation:*:*:stack/*/*\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    ],\n    \"attached_policies\": [\n      {\n        \"PolicyName\": \"LightsailExportAccess\",\n        \"PolicyId\": \"ANPAJ4LZGPQLZWMVR4WMQ\",\n        \"Arn\": \"arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/aws-service-role/LightsailExportAccess\",\n        \"Path\": \"/aws-service-role/\",\n        \"DefaultVersionId\": \"v2\",\n        \"AttachmentCount\": 1,\n        \"PermissionsBoundaryUsageCount\": 0,\n        \"IsAttachable\": true,\n        \"Description\": \"AWS Lightsail service linked role policy which grants permissions to export resources\",\n        \"CreateDate\": \"2018-09-28 16:35:54+00:00\",\n        \"UpdateDate\": \"2022-01-15 01:45:33+00:00\",\n        \"Tags\": [],\n        \"PolicyVersion\": {\n          \"Document\": {\n            \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n            \"Statement\": [\n              {\n                \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n                \"Action\": [\n                  \"iam:DeleteServiceLinkedRole\",\n                  \"iam:GetServiceLinkedRoleDeletionStatus\"\n                ],\n                \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:iam::*:role/aws-service-role/lightsail.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForLightsail*\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n                \"Action\": [\n                  \"ec2:CopySnapshot\",\n                  \"ec2:DescribeSnapshots\",\n                  \"ec2:CopyImage\",\n                  \"ec2:DescribeImages\"\n                ],\n                \"Resource\": \"*\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n                \"Action\": [\n                  \"s3:GetAccountPublicAccessBlock\"\n                ],\n                \"Resource\": \"*\"\n              }\n            ]\n          },\n          \"VersionId\": \"v2\",\n          \"IsDefaultVersion\": true,\n          \"CreateDate\": \"2022-01-15 01:45:33+00:00\"\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```\nAdd `--nl` to collapse these to single lines as valid newline-delimited JSON.\n\nAdd `--csv` or `--tsv` to get back CSV or TSV data.\n\n### delete-user\n\nIn trying out this tool it's possible you will create several different user accounts that you later decide to clean up.\n\nDeleting AWS users is a little fiddly: you first need to delete their access keys, then their inline policies and finally the user themselves.\n\nThe `s3-credentials delete-user` handles this for you:\n\n```\n% s3-credentials delete-user s3.read-write.simonw-test-bucket-10\nUser: s3.read-write.simonw-test-bucket-10\n  Deleted policy: s3.read-write.simonw-test-bucket-10\n  Deleted access key: AKIAWXFXAIOZK3GPEIWR\n  Deleted user\n```\nYou can pass it multiple usernames to delete multiple users at a time.\n\n### put-object\n\nYou can upload a file to a key in an S3 bucket using `s3-credentials put-object`:\n\n    s3-credentials put-object my-bucket my-key.txt /path/to/file.txt\n\nUse `-` as the file name to upload from standard input:\n\n    echo \"Hello\" | s3-credentials put-object my-bucket hello.txt -\n\nThis command shows a progress bar by default. Use `-s` or `--silent` to hide the progress bar.\n\nThe `Content-Type` on the uploaded object will be automatically set based on the file extension. If you are using standard input, or you want to over-ride the detected type, you can do so using the `--content-type` option:\n\n    echo \"<h1>Hello World</h1>\" | \\\n      s3-credentials put-object my-bucket hello.html - --content-type \"text/html\"\n\n### get-object\n\nTo download a file from a bucket use `s3-credentials get-object`:\n\n    s3-credentials get-object my-bucket hello.txt\n\nThis defaults to outputting the downloaded file to the terminal. You can instead direct it to save to a file on disk using the `-o` or `--output` option:\n\n    s3-credentials get-object my-bucket hello.txt -o /path/to/hello.txt\n\n\n### set-cors-policy and get-cors-policy\n\nYou can set the [CORS policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/cors.html) for a bucket using the `set-cors-policy` command. S3 CORS policies are set at the bucket level - they cannot be set for individual items.\n\nFirst, create the bucket. Make sure to make it `--public`:\n\n    s3-credentials create my-cors-bucket --public -c\n\nYou can set a default CORS policy - allowing `GET` requests from any origin - like this:\n\n    s3-credentials set-cors-policy my-cors-bucket\n\nYou can use the `get-cors-policy` command to confirm the policy you have set:\n\n    s3-credentials get-cors-policy my-cors-bucket\n    [\n        {\n            \"ID\": \"set-by-s3-credentials\",\n            \"AllowedMethods\": [\n                \"GET\"\n            ],\n            \"AllowedOrigins\": [\n                \"*\"\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n\nTo customize the CORS policy, use the following options:\n\n- `-m/--allowed-method` - Allowed method e.g. `GET`\n- `-h/--allowed-header` - Allowed header e.g. `Authorization`\n- `-o/--allowed-origin` - Allowed origin e.g. `https://www.example.com/`\n- `-e/--expose-header` -  Header to expose e.g. `ETag`\n- `--max-age-seconds` - How long to cache preflight requests\n\nEach of these can be passed multiple times with the exception of `--max-age-seconds`.\n\nThe following example allows GET and PUT methods from code running on `https://www.example.com/`, allows the encoming `Authorization` header and exposes the `ETag` header. It also sets the client to cache preflight requests for 60 seconds:\n\n    s3-credentials set-cors-policy my-cors-bucket2 \\\n      --allowed-method GET \\\n      --allowed-method PUT \\\n      --allowed-origin https://www.example.com/ \\\n      --expose-header ETag \\\n      --max-age-seconds 60\n\n## Common options\n\nAll of the `s3-credentials` commands also accept the following options for authenticating against AWS:\n\n- `--access-key`: AWS access key ID\n- `--secret-key`: AWS secret access key\n- `--session-token`: AWS session token\n- `--endpoint-url`: Custom endpoint URL\n- `--auth`: file (or `-` for standard input) containing credentials to use\n\nThe file passed to `--auth` can be either a JSON file or an INI file. JSON files should contain the following:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"AccessKeyId\": \"AKIAWXFXAIOZA5IR5PY4\",\n    \"SecretAccessKey\": \"g63...\"\n}\n```\nThe JSON file can also optionally include a session token in a `\"SessionToken\"` key.\n\nThe INI format variant of this file should look like this:\n\n```ini\n[default]\naws_access_key_id=AKIAWXFXAIOZNCR2ST7S\naws_secret_access_key=g63...\n```\nAny section headers will do - the tool will use the information from the first section it finds in the file which has a `aws_access_key_id` key.\n\nThese auth file formats are the same as those that can be created using the `create` command.\n\n## Tips\n\nYou can see a log of changes made by this tool using AWS CloudTrail - the following link should provide an Event History interface showing revelant changes made to your AWS account such as `CreateAccessKey`, `CreateUser`, `PutUserPolicy` and more:\n\nhttps://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/home\n\nYou can view a list of your S3 buckets and confirm that they have the desired permissions and properties here:\n\nhttps://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home\n\nThe management interface for an individual bucket is at `https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/NAME-OF-BUCKET`\n\n## Policy documents\n\nThe IAM policies generated by this tool for a bucket called `my-s3-bucket` would look like this:\n\n### read-write

Then create a new virtual environment:\n\n    cd s3-credentials\n    python -m venv venv\n    source venv/bin/activate\n\nOr if you are using `pipenv`:\n\n    pipenv shell\n\nNow install the dependencies and test dependencies:\n\n    pip install -e '.[test]'\n\nTo run the tests:\n\n    pytest\n\nAny changes to the generated policies require an update to the README using [Cog](https://github.com/nedbat/cog):\n\n    cog -r README.md\n\n### Integration tests\n\nThe main tests all use stubbed interfaces to AWS, so will not make any outbound API calls.\n\nThere is also a suite of integration tests in `tests/test_integration.py` which DO make API calls to AWS, using credentials from your environment variables or `~/.aws/credentials` file.\n\nThese tests are skipped by default. If you have AWS configured with an account that has permission to run the actions required by `s3-credentials` (create users, roles, buckets etc) you can run these tests using:\n\n    pytest --integration\n\nThe tests will create a number of different users and buckets and should then delete them once they finish running.\n",
